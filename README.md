My first discord.js project. I first created Tzuyu Bot.

Just want to store my bot source code here :))

I'm still learning about discord.js stuff so yeah a big thanks to all who helped me and for tutorial videos I've watched I really appreciate for uploading how to make discord bot tutorials and some discordjs features.

If you're confused viewing this, it's not fault AHUWHAHAH (JUST WANT TO SAVE MY BOT SOURCE CODE IN CASE I'LL DELETE THIS FOLDER IN MY PC)

I'm still learning about coding stuff, preparing for my 1st year college as I'm taking BSIT! FIGHTING FIGHTING!
